# Aivika Capture


Aivika is a complete document capture and workflow solution, which is designed to bring documents the moment it gets received to its final destination in the most efficient way. Aivika captures, processes and stores scanned documents as well as documents generated by other applications. Every document that goes to Aivika will go through these 3 primary functions.


## Capture
> Determines where documents come from (Scanner, Folder, E-mail client, Mobile client, etc) and how additional information related to the document, or metadata, should be retrieved.

## Process
> Determines what is done to the document. This could include barcode reading, recognizing texts with the help of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), conversion to another format, and much more.

## Store
> Determines where and how the document should be saved, which could be another folder on the network, a database, as an e-mail attachment, a Cloud Storage such as Dropbox or Google Drive, or a Document Management System such as SharePoint, DocuWare or NetDocuments.
