## **Layout**

The application contains two major pages:

1. Login page
2. Document list page

And is responsive on different screen sizes, ideally the chosen breakpoints are:

- Small (_smaller than 640 pixels_)
- Medium (_640 pixels to 1007 pixels_)
- Large (_1008 pixels and larger_)

Where the content of a page is the same across all screen sizes, only the mobile view is shown. The only difference on larger screen sizes will be that more of the content is visible.
