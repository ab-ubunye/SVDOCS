# What is ScannerVision?
ScannerVision is a solution to automate document workflows, which captures, processes and stores scanned documents as well as documents generated by other applications. 

Every document that goes to ScannerVision will go through these 3 primary functions.

## Capture
> Determines where documents come from (MFP, Desktop Modules/Clients, Hot Folder, E-mail, etc) and how additional information related to the document, or metadata, should be retrieved

## Process
> Determines what is done to the document. This could include barcode reading, recognizing texts with the help of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), conversion to another format, and much more

## Store
> Determines where and how the document should be saved, which could be another folder on the network, a database, as an e-mail attachment, a Cloud Storage such as Dropbox or Google Drive, or a Document Management System such as SharePoint, DocuWare or NetDocuments
