I"9<p>The Model Editor in DocVolante allows you to create and manage your own custom models. This is a user-friendly tool that enables you to add custom types, aspects and properties to your models.</p>

<p><strong>What is a model?</strong></p>

<p>A model is a fundamental building block of the content repository that provides a foundation for structuring content and working with content. A model has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It describes the data being stored.</li>
  <li>It allows the management of content metadata by applying custom types or aspects to the content and folders.</li>
  <li>It is uniquely identified by its defined Namespace, Prefix, and Name.</li>
  <li>It is defined using a small set of building blocks: custom types, aspects, properties, and constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Custom types</strong></p>

<p>A custom type enumerates the properties and relationships that a file of that type can support. Typically, types represents nodes with support for properties and the ability to inherit the definition of a parent type. Content and Folder are the two important types defined out-of-the-box.</p>

<p><strong>Aspects</strong></p>

<p>An aspect is a collection of properties that can encapsulate both data and behaviour, providing a flexible tool for modeling content. Aspects add extra functionality and properties to the models by attaching them to custom types. A file must be of a single type, but may have one or more aspects attached to it. By default, the content repository comprises of some out-of-the-box aspects, such as Classifiable, Versionable, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that the current version of the Model Editor does not support the creation of aspects.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>

<p>Properties are metadata which describes the content. For example, Author is a property which specifies the person who wrote the content.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<p>Constraints control the input property values. For example, you can specify that the author name must not be more than 40 characters.</p>
