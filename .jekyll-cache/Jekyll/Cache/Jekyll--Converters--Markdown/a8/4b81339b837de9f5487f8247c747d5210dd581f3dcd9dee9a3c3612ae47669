I",<p>You can create new models using the Model Editor page.</p>

<p>Please note that the current version of the model editor does not support the creation of models yet. But you can modify an existing model by editing itâ€™s content through custom types and properties.
Have a look at the custom type and property section for more details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the model namespace.
Namespaces provide a way to specify globally unique names for definitions within content models. All custom types, aspects, and properties have names which are made unique across the repository by using a namespace specific to the model. Using namespaces prevents name collisions when the models are shared across repositories. A namespace is composed of a URI and a prefix.
Only alphanumeric characters or a URI, for example, http://www.mycompany.com/model/mynamespace/1.0, are allowed.
<strong>Do not use spaces or special characters and the namespace value must be unique within the repository.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a short prefix for the model.
A prefix is just an abbreviation for the namespace identifier (URI), which is typically quite long. For example, if the namespace URI is http://example.org/contentmodels and associated prefix is ex, then the name <strong>ex:customtype</strong> means that customtype is a name defined within the namespace http://example.org/contentmodels.
Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed. Do not use spaces.
<strong>The prefix value must be unique within the repository.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a name for the model.
For example, Finance.
Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed. Do not use spaces or special characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specify an optional author for the model.
If you leave this field blank, it will be auto-filled, it is based on the current signed in user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter an optional description for the model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click Create.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The new model will appear in the Models List view on the Model Editor page.
Additional information in the Models List view include the model ID and the model Status.</p>
