I"Á<p>This section gives the user the experience of interactively dragging documents or folders in the drag-drop viewer contained in different components views such as the Share or Documents components.</p>

<p>When performing the operation the browser displays the document or folder being dragged as a ghost element attached to the mouse pointer with a plus <strong>(+)</strong> or arrow <strong>(-&gt;)</strong> sign.</p>

<p>The arrow sign indicates that the document or folder being dragged can be dropped and saved in the selected directory.</p>

<p><img src="/en/attachments/51.png" alt="/en/attachments/51.png" /><img src="/en/attachments/49.png" alt="/en/attachments/49.png" /></p>

<p>Note that if the user drops a document or a folder while the sign is still <strong>(+)</strong>, the element dropped will not be saved.</p>

<p>A good practice will be to open the folder directory in which you want to save the document or folder to. Drag the element in the directory view and drop it when you see the plus <strong>(+)</strong> changing to an arrow <strong>(-&gt;)</strong> sign.</p>

<p>After performing the operation the browser will notify the user if the process was successful or not.
The document or folder dropped will be saved in the current directory selected.</p>

<p>Note that only Folders of .zip format can be dragged and dropped. The format does not matter for documents.</p>
