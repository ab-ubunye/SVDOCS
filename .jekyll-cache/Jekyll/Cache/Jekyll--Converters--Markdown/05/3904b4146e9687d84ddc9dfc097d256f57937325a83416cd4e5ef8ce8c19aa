<p><strong>Versioning</strong></p>

<p>Versions refer to different uploads of one document.
The user has the option of uploading multiple versions of one document. 
Each uploaded document is an update of the previous document uploaded, meaning that the newly uploaded document will replace the previous uploaded document and be saved in the same directory location as the previous uploaded document.
Note that when a new version is being uploaded the previous version is not deleted but kept instead in the Document History. 
There is not limit in the number of versions that can be uploaded.
When uploading a document the user has the options as well of adding a description that would further explain the uploaded document.</p>

<p><strong>Document History</strong></p>

<p>Document History refers to a list of all uploaded versions of one document.</p>

<p>Each version uploaded can be restored, downloaded or deleted. 
When restored, the document will replace the previous uploaded document.</p>
