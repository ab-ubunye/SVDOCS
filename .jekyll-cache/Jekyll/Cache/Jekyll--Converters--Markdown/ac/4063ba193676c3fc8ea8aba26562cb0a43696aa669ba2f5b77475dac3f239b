<p><code>this is the Spanish version</code></p>

<p>As of version 0.0.12, mkdocs-jekyll has support for basic quizzes! These are
intended to help educate your users about the content of your documentation.
For a quiz, you can add a new file to the folder <code>_data/quizzes</code>, and write a 
questions file based on the format shown in <code>_data/quizzes/example-quiz.yml</code>.
Here is a simple example of a multiple choice question (which can also serve as 
True/False):</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">title: This is the Quiz Title
randomized: false
questions:

 - type: "multiple-choice"
   question: "True or False, Pittsburgh is West of Philadelphia"
   items:
    - choice: True
      correct: true
    - choice: False
      correct: false
   followup: | 
      The answer is True! Pittsburgh is 304.9 miles West of 
      Philadelphia, or approximately a car ride of 
      4 hours and 52 minutes. Buckle up!
</code></pre>

<p>The quiz is rendered with a “Show Answer” button below each question, and when
the user clicks it, any questions that are flagged with <code>correct: true</code> will be 
bolded, and if a followup section is included, it will be displayed.
See the live example at the end of this page.</p>

<h2 id="options">Options</h2>

<h4 id="title">Title</h4>

<p>If you include a title, it will be rendered at the top of the quiz. This is
optional - you can leave it out and add it before the include on the page.</p>

<h4 id="random">Random</h4>

<p>If you want your questions to be presented randomly, just add randomized: true
to the data.</p>
