						"content": "Getting Started\n\nthis is the english version sss\n\nFeatures\n\nUser Interaction\n\nOn the right side of any page, you’ll notice links to edit the page, or\nopen an issue. This ensures that any time you have a question or want to \nsuggest or request a change, you can do so immediately and link directly\nto the section of interest. The sections on the page also have permalinks so\nyou can link directly to them.\n\nSearch\n\nThe entire site, including posts and documentation, is indexed and then available\nfor search at the top or side of the page. Give it a try! The content is rendered\ninto window data that is used by lunr.js to generate the search results.\nIf you want to exclude any file from search, add this to its front end matter:\n\n---\nlayout: null\nexcluded_in_search: true\n---\n\n\nThe example above is for a javascript file in the assets folder that is used as a template,\nbut should not be included in search.\n\nExternal Search\n\nIf you have an external site with a search GET endpoint (meaning one that ends\nin ?q=&lt;term&gt;, then you can automatically link page tags to search this endpoint.\nFor example, on an HPC site I’d want a tag like “mpi” to do a search on \nhttp://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org for mpi.\nSee the tags section below for how to configure this.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation pages should be written in the docs folder of the repository,\nand you are allowed to use whatever level of nesting (subfolders) that \nworks for you! It’s a Jekyll collection, which means that you\ncan add other content (images, scripts) and it will be included for linking to.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe url that will render is based on the path. For example, if we had the following structure:\n\ndocs/\n  getting-started.md\n  clusters/\n     sherlock/\n         getting-started.md\n\n\nThe first page (akin to the one you are reading) would render at it’s path,\n/docs/getting-started/.\n\nLinking\n\nFrom that page, we could provide the\ndirect path in markdown to any subfolder to link to it, such as the second\ngetting started page for sherlock:\n\n[example](clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nHere is an example link to a relative path of a file (example-page.md)\nin the same directory, and from that page you can test linking to a subfoldr.\nIn the case of not having a subfolder, we could write the link out directly:\n\n[example]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nor just put the relative path:\n\n[Here](example-page)\n\n\nor better, there is a shortand trick! We can use the provided “includes” \ntemplate to do the same based on the path to create a link:\n\n{% include doc.html name=\"Sherlock Cluster\" path=\"clusters/sherlock/getting-started\" %}\n\nThe path should be relative to the docs folder.\n\nPages\n\nThe pages folder uses the same page layout, but is not part of the docs collection.\nThe two are provided to create a distinction between website pages (e.g., about,\nfeed.xml) and documentation pages.\n\nNavigation\n\nWhether you place your page under “pages” or “docs,” for those pages that you want added to the navigation, \nyou should add them to _data/toc.yml. If you’ve defined a permalink in the\nfront end matter, you can use that (e.g., “About” below). If you haven’t and\nwant to link to docs, the url is the path starting with the docs folder.\nHere is an example (currently the active example):\n\n- title: Documentation\n  url: docs\n  links:\n    - title: \"Getting Started\"\n      url: \"docs/getting-started\"\n      children:\n        - title: Features\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#getting-started\"\n        - title: Development\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#development\"\n        - title: Customization\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#customization\"\n    - title: \"Extras\"\n      url: \"docs/extras\"\n      children:\n        - title: Quizzes\n          url: \"docs/extras/example-quiz\"\n    - title: \"About\"\n      url: \"about\"\n    - title: \"News\"\n      url: \"news\n\n\nIf you want to add an external url for a parent or child, do this:\n\n  - title: GitHub Repository\n    external_url: https://www.github.com/vsoch/mkdocs-jekyll\n\n\nNews Posts\n\nIt might be the case that your site or group has news items that would\nwarrent sharing with the community, and should be available as a feed.\nFor this reason, you can write traditional posts in the _posts\nfolder that will parse into the site feed\nThe bottom of the page links the user to a post archive, where posts are organized\naccording to the year.\n\nButtons\n\nButtons come in a nice array of colors. Here is the code for a basic example,\nand you’d want to vary the .btn-&lt;tag&gt; to get different classes.\n\n&lt;button class=\"btn btn-success\"&gt;.btn-success&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\n.btn-success\n.btn-info\n.btn-secondary\n.btn-primary\n.btn-danger\n.btn-warning\n\nBadges\n\nFor news post items, it’s nice to be able to tag it with something that indicates\na status, such as “warning” or “alert.” For this reason, you can add badges to\nthe front end matter of any post page, and they will render colored by a type,\nwith the tag of your choice. For example, here is an example header for\na post:\n\n---\ntitle:  \"Two Thousand Nineteen\"\ndate:   2019-06-28 18:52:21\ncategories: jekyll update\nbadges:\n - type: warning\n   tag: warning-badge\n - type: danger\n   tag: danger-badge\n---\n\n\nAnd here is the post preview with the rendered badges that it produces:\n\nwarning-badge\ndanger-badge\n\nAnd the other badges that you can define include success, info, secondary,\nand primary.\n\nsuccess-badge\ninfo-badge\nsecondary-badge\nprimary-badge\n\nAlerts\n\n\n    What is an alert?\n    An alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:\n    \n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nJust for fun, here are all the types:\n\n\n    warning\n    This is a warning\n    \n\n\n    danger\n    This alerts danger!\n    \n\n\n    success\n    This alerts success\n    \n\n\n    info\n    This is useful information.\n    \n\n\n    primary\n    This is a primary alert\n    \n\n\n    secondary\n    This is a secondary alert\n    \n\nQuotes\n\nYou can include block quotes to emphasize text.\n\n\n  Here is an example. Isn’t this much more prominent to the user?\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nInitially (on OS X), you will need to setup Brew which is a package manager for OS X and Git. To install Brew and Git, run the following commands:\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nbrew install git\n\n\nIf you are on Debian/Ubuntu, then you can easily install git with apt-get\n\napt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y git\n\n\nInstall Jekyll\n\nYou can also install Jekyll with brew.\n\n$ brew install ruby\n$ gem install jekyll\n$ gem install bundler\n$ bundle install\n\n\nOn Ubuntu I do a different method:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nexec $SHELL\nrbenv install 2.3.1\nrbenv global 2.3.1\ngem install bundler\nrbenv rehash\nruby -v\n\n# Rails\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\ngem install rails -v 4.2.6\nrbenv rehash\n\n# Jekyll\ngem install jekyll\ngem install github-pages\ngem install jekyll-sass-converter\n\nrbenv rehash\n\n\nGet the code\n\nYou should first fork the repository to your GitHub organization or username,\nand then clone it.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/mkdocs-jekyll.git docs\n$ cd docs\n\n\nYou can clone the repository right to where you want to host the docs:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/mkdocs-jekyll.git docs\n$ cd docs\n\n\nServe\n\nDepending on how you installed jekyll:\n\njekyll serve\n# or\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n\n\nPreview\n\nWe provide a CircleCI configuration recipe that you\ncan use to preview your site on CircleCI before merging into master. You\nshould follow the instructions to set up a project,\nand then in the project settings be sure to enable building forked build requests,\nand to cancel redundant builds. The preview will be built on CircleCI, and saved\nto static files for you to browse. The only change you will need is to edit\nthe static files location to be the name of your respository, which is at te\nbottom of the .circleci/config.yml file:\n\n      - store_artifacts:\n          path: ~/repo/_site\n          destination: mkdocs-jekyll\n\n\nIn the above, the destination should coincide with your repository name.\nRemember that for most links, CircleCI won’t honor an index.html file in a subfolder\n(e.g., subfolder/index.html will not be served as subfolder/, so for example,\nyou might need to turn this:\n\nhttps://&lt;circleci&gt;/0/mkdocs-jekyll/docs/getting-started/\n\ninto this:\n\nhttps://&lt;circleci&gt;/0/mkdocs-jekyll/docs/getting-started/index.html\n\n\nCustomization\n\nconfig.yml\n\nTo edit configuration values, customize the _config.yml.\nMost are documented there, and please open an issue if you have questions.\n\nAdding pages\n\nTo add pages, write them into the pages folder. \nYou define urls based on the permalink attribute in your pages,\nand then add them to the navigation by adding to the content of _data/toc.yml.\n\nTags\n\nIf you include tags on a page, by default they will link to the tags page on the site. However, if you define a tag_search_endpoint url in your configuration file, by clicking\nthe tag, the user will be taken to this page to search for it.

This ensures that any time you have a question or want to \nsuggest or request a change, you can do so immediately and link directly\nto the section of interest. The sections on the page also have permalinks so\nyou can link directly to them.\n\nSearch\n\nThe entire site, including posts and documentation, is indexed and then available\nfor search at the top or side of the page. Give it a try! The content is rendered\ninto window data that is used by lunr.js to generate the search results.\nIf you want to exclude any file from search, add this to its front end matter:\n\n---\nlayout: null\nexcluded_in_search: true\n---\n\n\nThe example above is for a javascript file in the assets folder that is used as a template,\nbut should not be included in search.\n\nExternal Search\n\nIf you have an external site with a search GET endpoint (meaning one that ends\nin ?q=&lt;term&gt;, then you can automatically link page tags to search this endpoint.\nFor example, on an HPC site I’d want a tag like “mpi” to do a search on \nhttp://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org for mpi.\nSee the tags section below for how to configure this.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation pages should be written in the docs folder of the repository,\nand you are allowed to use whatever level of nesting (subfolders) that \nworks for you! It’s a Jekyll collection, which means that you\ncan add other content (images, scripts) and it will be included for linking to.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe url that will render is based on the path. For example, if we had the following structure:\n\ndocs/\n  getting-started.md\n  clusters/\n     sherlock/\n         getting-started.md\n\n\nThe first page (akin to the one you are reading) would render at it’s path,\n/docs/getting-started/.\n\nLinking\n\nFrom that page, we could provide the\ndirect path in markdown to any subfolder to link to it, such as the second\ngetting started page for sherlock:\n\n[example](clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nHere is an example link to a relative path of a file (example-page.md)\nin the same directory, and from that page you can test linking to a subfoldr.\nIn the case of not having a subfolder, we could write the link out directly:\n\n[example]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nor just put the relative path:\n\n[Here](example-page)\n\n\nor better, there is a shortand trick! We can use the provided “includes” \ntemplate to do the same based on the path to create a link:\n\n{% include doc.html name=\"Sherlock Cluster\" path=\"clusters/sherlock/getting-started\" %}\n\nThe path should be relative to the docs folder.\n\nPages\n\nThe pages folder uses the same page layout, but is not part of the docs collection.\nThe two are provided to create a distinction between website pages (e.g., about,\nfeed.xml) and documentation pages.\n\nNavigation\n\nWhether you place your page under “pages” or “docs,” for those pages that you want added to the navigation, \nyou should add them to _data/toc.yml. If you’ve defined a permalink in the\nfront end matter, you can use that (e.g., “About” below). If you haven’t and\nwant to link to docs, the url is the path starting with the docs folder.\nHere is an example (currently the active example):\n\n- title: Documentation\n  url: docs\n  links:\n    - title: \"Getting Started\"\n      url: \"docs/getting-started\"\n      children:\n        - title: Features\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#getting-started\"\n        - title: Development\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#development\"\n        - title: Customization\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#customization\"\n    - title: \"Extras\"\n      url: \"docs/extras\"\n      children:\n        - title: Quizzes\n          url: \"docs/extras/example-quiz\"\n    - title: \"About\"\n      url: \"about\"\n    - title: \"News\"\n      url: \"news\n\n\nIf you want to add an external url for a parent or child, do this:\n\n  - title: GitHub Repository\n    external_url: https://www.github.com/vsoch/mkdocs-jekyll\n\n\nNews Posts\n\nIt might be the case that your site or group has news items that would\nwarrent sharing with the community, and should be available as a feed.\nFor this reason, you can write traditional posts in the _posts\nfolder that will parse into the site feed\nThe bottom of the page links the user to a post archive, where posts are organized\naccording to the year.\n\nButtons\n\nButtons come in a nice array of colors. Here is the code for a basic example,\nand you’d want to vary the .btn-&lt;tag&gt; to get different classes.\n\n&lt;button class=\"btn btn-success\"&gt;.btn-success&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\n.btn-success\n.btn-info\n.btn-secondary\n.btn-primary\n.btn-danger\n.btn-warning\n\nBadges\n\nFor news post items, it’s nice to be able to tag it with something that indicates\na status, such as “warning” or “alert.” For this reason, you can add badges to\nthe front end matter of any post page, and they will render colored by a type,\nwith the tag of your choice. For example, here is an example header for\na post:\n\n---\ntitle:  \"Two Thousand Nineteen\"\ndate:   2019-06-28 18:52:21\ncategories: jekyll update\nbadges:\n - type: warning\n   tag: warning-badge\n - type: danger\n   tag: danger-badge\n---\n\n\nAnd here is the post preview with the rendered badges that it produces:\n\nwarning-badge\ndanger-badge\n\nAnd the other badges that you can define include success, info, secondary,\nand primary.\n\nsuccess-badge\ninfo-badge\nsecondary-badge\nprimary-badge\n\nAlerts\n\n\n    What is an alert?\n    An alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:\n    \n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nJust for fun, here are all the types:\n\n\n    warning\n    This is a warning\n    \n\n\n    danger\n    This alerts danger!\n    \n\n\n    success\n    This alerts success\n    \n\n\n    info\n    This is useful information.\n    \n\n\n    primary\n    This is a primary alert\n    \n\n\n    secondary\n    This is a secondary alert\n    \n\nQuotes\n\nYou can include block quotes to emphasize text.\n\n\n  Here is an example.

						"content": "Quizzes\n\nthis is the english version\n\nAs of version 0.0.12, mkdocs-jekyll has support for basic quizzes! These are\nintended to help educate your users about the content of your documentation.\nFor a quiz, you can add a new file to the folder _data/quizzes, and write a \nquestions file based on the format shown in _data/quizzes/example-quiz.yml.\nHere is a simple example of a multiple choice question (which can also serve as \nTrue/False):\n\ntitle: This is the Quiz Title\nrandomized: false\nquestions:\n\n - type: \"multiple-choice\"\n   question: \"True or False, Pittsburgh is West of Philadelphia\"\n   items:\n    - choice: True\n      correct: true\n    - choice: False\n      correct: false\n   followup: | \n      The answer is True! Pittsburgh is 304.9 miles West of \n      Philadelphia, or approximately a car ride of \n      4 hours and 52 minutes. Buckle up!\n\n\nThe quiz is rendered with a “Show Answer” button below each question, and when\nthe user clicks it, any questions that are flagged with correct: true will be \nbolded, and if a followup section is included, it will be displayed.\nSee the live example at the end of this page.\n\nOptions\n\nTitle\n\nIf you include a title, it will be rendered at the top of the quiz. This is\noptional - you can leave it out and add it before the include on the page.\n\nRandom\n\nIf you want your questions to be presented randomly, just add randomized: true\nto the data.\n\nExample Quiz\n\nIf I want to include the quiz located at _data/quizzes/example-quiz.yml, I \ncan do so like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe rendered quiz is shown here:"

						"title": "Getting Started",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /docs/getting-started",
						"content": "Getting Started\n\nthis is the english version sss\n\nFeatures\n\nUser Interaction\n\nOn the right side of any page, you’ll notice links to edit the page, or\nopen an issue. This ensures that any time you have a question or want to \nsuggest or request a change, you can do so immediately and link directly\nto the section of interest. The sections on the page also have permalinks so\nyou can link directly to them.\n\nSearch\n\nThe entire site, including posts and documentation, is indexed and then available\nfor search at the top or side of the page. Give it a try! The content is rendered\ninto window data that is used by lunr.js to generate the search results.\nIf you want to exclude any file from search, add this to its front end matter:\n\n---\nlayout: null\nexcluded_in_search: true\n---\n\n\nThe example above is for a javascript file in the assets folder that is used as a template,\nbut should not be included in search.\n\nExternal Search\n\nIf you have an external site with a search GET endpoint (meaning one that ends\nin ?q=&lt;term&gt;, then you can automatically link page tags to search this endpoint.\nFor example, on an HPC site I’d want a tag like “mpi” to do a search on \nhttp://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org for mpi.\nSee the tags section below for how to configure this.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation pages should be written in the docs folder of the repository,\nand you are allowed to use whatever level of nesting (subfolders) that \nworks for you! It’s a Jekyll collection, which means that you\ncan add other content (images, scripts) and it will be included for linking to.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe url that will render is based on the path. For example, if we had the following structure:\n\ndocs/\n  getting-started.md\n  clusters/\n     sherlock/\n         getting-started.md\n\n\nThe first page (akin to the one you are reading) would render at it’s path,\n/docs/getting-started/.\n\nLinking\n\nFrom that page, we could provide the\ndirect path in markdown to any subfolder to link to it, such as the second\ngetting started page for sherlock:\n\n[example](clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nHere is an example link to a relative path of a file (example-page.md)\nin the same directory, and from that page you can test linking to a subfoldr.\nIn the case of not having a subfolder, we could write the link out directly:\n\n[example]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/clusters/sherlock/getting-started.md)\n\n\nor just put the relative path:\n\n[Here](example-page)\n\n\nor better, there is a shortand trick! We can use the provided “includes” \ntemplate to do the same based on the path to create a link:\n\n{% include doc.html name=\"Sherlock Cluster\" path=\"clusters/sherlock/getting-started\" %}\n\nThe path should be relative to the docs folder.\n\nPages\n\nThe pages folder uses the same page layout, but is not part of the docs collection.\nThe two are provided to create a distinction between website pages (e.g., about,\nfeed.xml) and documentation pages.\n\nNavigation\n\nWhether you place your page under “pages” or “docs,” for those pages that you want added to the navigation, \nyou should add them to _data/toc.yml. If you’ve defined a permalink in the\nfront end matter, you can use that (e.g., “About” below). If you haven’t and\nwant to link to docs, the url is the path starting with the docs folder.\nHere is an example (currently the active example):\n\n- title: Documentation\n  url: docs\n  links:\n    - title: \"Getting Started\"\n      url: \"docs/getting-started\"\n      children:\n        - title: Features\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#getting-started\"\n        - title: Development\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#development\"\n        - title: Customization\n          url: \"docs/getting-started#customization\"\n    - title: \"Extras\"\n      url: \"docs/extras\"\n      children:\n        - title: Quizzes\n          url: \"docs/extras/example-quiz\"\n    - title: \"About\"\n      url: \"about\"\n    - title: \"News\"\n      url: \"news\n\n\nIf you want to add an external url for a parent or child, do this:\n\n  - title: GitHub Repository\n    external_url: https://www.github.com/vsoch/mkdocs-jekyll\n\n\nNews Posts\n\nIt might be the case that your site or group has news items that would\nwarrent sharing with the community, and should be available as a feed.\nFor this reason, you can write traditional posts in the _posts\nfolder that will parse into the site feed\nThe bottom of the page links the user to a post archive, where posts are organized\naccording to the year.\n\nButtons\n\nButtons come in a nice array of colors. Here is the code for a basic example,\nand you’d want to vary the .btn-&lt;tag&gt; to get different classes.\n\n&lt;button class=\"btn btn-success\"&gt;.btn-success&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\n.btn-success\n.btn-info\n.btn-secondary\n.btn-primary\n.btn-danger\n.btn-warning\n\nBadges\n\nFor news post items, it’s nice to be able to tag it with something that indicates\na status, such as “warning” or “alert.” For this reason, you can add badges to\nthe front end matter of any post page, and they will render colored by a type,\nwith the tag of your choice. For example, here is an example header for\na post:\n\n---\ntitle:  \"Two Thousand Nineteen\"\ndate:   2019-06-28 18:52:21\ncategories: jekyll update\nbadges:\n - type: warning\n   tag: warning-badge\n - type: danger\n   tag: danger-badge\n---\n\n\nAnd here is the post preview with the rendered badges that it produces:\n\nwarning-badge\ndanger-badge\n\nAnd the other badges that you can define include success, info, secondary,\nand primary.\n\nsuccess-badge\ninfo-badge\nsecondary-badge\nprimary-badge\n\nAlerts\n\n\n    What is an alert?\n    An alert is a box that can stand out to indicate important information. You can choose from levels success, warning, danger, info, and primary. This example is an info box, and the code for another might look like this:\n    \n\n{% include alert.html type=\"info\" title=\"Here is another!\" %}\n\n\nJust for fun, here are all the types:\n\n\n    warning\n    This is a warning\n    \n\n\n    danger\n    This alerts danger!\n    \n\n\n    success\n    This alerts success\n    \n\n\n    info\n    This is useful information.\n    \n\n\n    primary\n    This is a primary alert\n    \n\n\n    secondary\n    This is a secondary alert\n    \n\nQuotes\n\nYou can include block quotes to emphasize text.\n\n\n  Here is an example. Isn’t this much more prominent to the user?\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nInitially (on OS X), you will need to setup Brew which is a package manager for OS X and Git. To install Brew and Git, run the following commands:\n\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nbrew install git\n\n\nIf you are on Debian/Ubuntu, then you can easily install git with apt-get\n\napt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y git\n\n\nInstall Jekyll\n\nYou can also install Jekyll with brew.\n\n$ brew install ruby\n$ gem install jekyll\n$ gem install bundler\n$ bundle install\n\n\nOn Ubuntu I do a different method:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nexec $SHELL\nrbenv install 2.3.1\nrbenv global 2.3.1\ngem install bundler\nrbenv rehash\nruby -v\n\n# Rails\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\ngem install rails -v 4.2.6\nrbenv rehash\n\n# Jekyll\ngem install jekyll\ngem install github-pages\ngem install jekyll-sass-converter\n\nrbenv rehash\n\n\nGet the code\n\nYou should first fork the repository to your GitHub organization or username,\nand then clone it.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/mkdocs-jekyll.git docs\n$ cd docs\n\n\nYou can clone the repository right to where you want to host the docs:\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/mkdocs-jekyll.git docs\n$ cd docs\n\n\nServe\n\nDepending on how you installed jekyll:\n\njekyll serve\n# or\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n\n\nPreview\n\nWe provide a CircleCI configuration recipe that you\ncan use to preview your site on CircleCI before merging into master. You\nshould follow the instructions to set up a project,\nand then in the project settings be sure to enable building forked build requests,\nand to cancel redundant builds. The preview will be built on CircleCI, and saved\nto static files for you to browse. The only change you will need is to edit\nthe static files location to be the name of your respository, which is at te\nbottom of the .circleci/config.yml file:\n\n      - store_artifacts:\n          path: ~/repo/_site\n          destination: mkdocs-jekyll\n\n\nIn the above, the destination should coincide with your repository name.\nRemember that for most links, CircleCI won’t honor an index.html file in a subfolder\n(e.g., subfolder/index.html will not be served as subfolder/, so for example,\nyou might need to turn this:\n\nhttps://&lt;circleci&gt;/0/mkdocs-jekyll/docs/getting-started/\n\ninto this:\n\nhttps://&lt;circleci&gt;/0/mkdocs-jekyll/docs/getting-started/index.html\n\n\nCustomization\n\nconfig.yml\n\nTo edit configuration values, customize the _config.yml.\nMost are documented there, and please open an issue if you have questions.\n\nAdding pages\n\nTo add pages, write them into the pages folder. \nYou define urls based on the permalink attribute in your pages,\nand then add them to the navigation by adding to the content of _data/toc.yml.\n\nTags\n\nIf you include tags on a page, by default they will link to the tags page on the site. However, if you define a tag_search_endpoint url in your configuration file, by clicking\nthe tag, the user will be taken to this page to search for it. As an example,\nwe define the current search endpoint to be Ask Cyberinfrastructure, and\npage tags link to a search on it:\n\ntag_search_endpoint: https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/search?q=\ntag_color: danger # danger, success, warning, primary, secondary, info\n\n\nNote that you can also choose a color! The tags appear at the top of the page,\nas they do on this page. The tags should be defined like this in the front end\nmatter:\n\ntags: \n - jekyll\n - github\n\n\nThey are appended to the first h1 block, so generally your pages should have a header.\nIf you comment out this variable, then each of your tags will link to it’s appropriate\nspot on the tags page linked above.\n\n#tag_search_endpoint: https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/search?q=\ntag_color: primary # danger, success, warning, primary, info, secondary\n\nDevelopmentss"
